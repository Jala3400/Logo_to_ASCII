# Tips for Creating Images

The application draws with characters. They don't have the ability to show details, but they have shape.

It is not recommended to have details smaller than one of these blocks, unless the shape matches that of a specific character.

Make vector drawings (.svg) and then convert it to an image.
Draw defined edges and wide surfaces.

To facilitate design, you can use a grid and ensure that the edges of the drawing always coincide with the edges and corners of a block. The default font makes 8x16 blocks, but you should check it with the `--verbose` argument.
